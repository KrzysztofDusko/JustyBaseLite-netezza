# JustyBaseLite Netezza Driver

This driver is a **TypeScript reimplementation** of the [JustyBase.NetezzaDriver](https://github.com/KrzysztofDusko/JustyBase.NetezzaDriver).

It allows for direct connection to IBM Netezza / PureData System for Analytics databases without the need for ODBC drivers or external dependencies.

> **Note**: The `node-netezza` package is included in this project specifically for **benchmarking** purposes, and `odbc` is included for **testing** purposes to ensure compatibility and correctness.
